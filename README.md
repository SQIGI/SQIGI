- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m George
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, the digitalization of society, and staying active outdoors.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C/C++; Assembler Python: Bash
- ðŸ“« How to reach me https://t.me/pifsto
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m the kind of person who can make a processor dance in assembly and have Python scripts write themselves. When I write code, bugs are too scared to appear, and compilers give me a standing ovation. My love for C++ and Bash is so strong that I can explain the difference between a pointer and a reference even in my sleep. ðŸ˜Ž
